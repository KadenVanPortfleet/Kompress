# Kompress
Kompress (Kaden Compressor) is a project I started for my work at Davenport University. This software is intended as an experiment and should NOT be used commercially or for any use outside of deconstruction, study, or fun. Thank you and enjoy!

# Use
The goal of this program is to take an input text file of any size and create a search tree as a mechanism of compression.
